    "## The Model\n",
    "Now it's time to build the deep learning model that will be used to perform the image classification. We will keeps things simple and stack a few dense layers and a dropout layer to train our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss a bit about the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First of all the following structure involving a `class` is standard code that's used to build the neural network model in PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # layers go here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # computations go here\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The layers are defined inside `def __init__()`. `super(...).__init__()` is just there to stick things together. For our model, we stack a hidden layer (`self.d1`) followed by a dropout layer (`self.dropout`), which is then followed by an output layer (`self.d2`). \n",
    "- `nn.Linear(...)` defines the dense layer and it requires the `in` and `out` dimensions, which corresponds to the size of the input feature and output feature of that layer, respectively. \n",
    "- `nn.Dropout(...)` is used to define a dropout layer. Dropout is an approach in deep learning that helps a model to avoid overfitting. This means that dropout acts as a regularization technique that helps the model to not overfit on the images it has seen while training. We want this because we need a model that generalizes well to unseen examples -- in our case, the testing dataset. Dropout randomly zeroes some of the units of the neural network layer with probability of `p=0.2`. Read more about the dropout layer [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout). \n",
    "- The entry point of the model, i.e. where the data enters, is placed under the `forward(...)` function. Typically, we also place other transformations we perform on the data while training inside this function. \n",
    "- In the `forward()` function we are performing a series of computations on the input data\n",
    "    - we flatten the images first, converting it from 2D (`28 X 28`) to 1D (`1 X 784`).\n",
    "    - then we feed the batches of those 1D images into the first hidden layer\n",
    "    - the output of that hidden layer is then applied a [non-linear activate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) called `ReLU`. It's not so important to know what `F.relu()` does at the moment, but the effect that it achieves is that it allows faster and more effective training of neural architectures on large datasets\n",
    "    - as explained above, the dropout also helps the model to train more efficiently by avoiding overfitting on the training data\n",
    "    - we then feed the output of that dropout layer into the output layer (`d2`)\n",
    "    - the result of that is then fed to the [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function), which converts or normalized the output into a probability distribution which helps with outputting proper predictions values that are used to calculate the accuracy of the model; this will the final output of the model"
